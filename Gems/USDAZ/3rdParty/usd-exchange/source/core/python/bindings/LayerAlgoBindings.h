            Set metadata on the ``Sdf.Layer`` indicating the provenance of the data.

            It is desirable to capture data provenance information into the metadata of SdfLayers, in order to keep track of what tools & versions
            were used throughout content creation pipelines, and to capture notes from the content author. While OpenUSD does not currently have a
            formal specification for this authoring metadata, some conventions have emerged throughout the OpenUSD Ecosystem.

            The most common convention for tool tracking is to include a "creator" string in the ``Sdf.Layer.customLayerData``. Similarly, notes from
            the content author should be captured via ``Sdf.Layer.SetComment``. While these are trivial using ``Sdf.Layer`` public methods, they are
            also easy to forget, and difficult to discover.

            This function assists authoring applications in settings authoring metadata, so that each application can produce consistant provenance
            information. The metadata should only add information which can be used to track the data back to its origin. It should not be used to
            store sensitive information about the content, nor about the end user (i.e. do not use it to store Personal Identifier Information).

            Example:

                .. code-block:: python

                    layer = Sdf.Layer.CreateAnonymous()
                    authoring_metadata = "My Content EditorÂ® 2024 SP 2, USD Exporter Plugin v1.1.23.11"
                    usdex.core.exportLayer(layer, file_name, authoring_metadata, user_comment);

            Note:

                This metadata is strictly informational, it is not advisable to drive runtime behavior from this metadata.
