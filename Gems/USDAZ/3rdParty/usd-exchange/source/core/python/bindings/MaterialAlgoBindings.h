            The UsdPreviewSurface specification requires the texture reader to provide data that is properly scaled and ready to be consumed as a
            tangent space normal. Textures stored in 8-bit file formats require scale and bias adjustment to transform the normals into tangent space.

            This module cannot read the provided ``texturePath`` to inspect the channel data (the file may not resolve locally, or even exist yet).
            To account for this, it performs the scale and bias adjustment when the `texturePath` extension matches a list of known 8-bit formats:
            ``["bmp", "tga", "jpg", "jpeg", "png", "tif"]``. Similarly, it assumes that the raw normals data was written into the file, regardless of
            any file format specific color space metadata. If either of these assumptions is incorrect for your source data, you will need to adjust
            the ``scale``, ``bias``, and ``sourceColorSpace`` settings after calling this function.
